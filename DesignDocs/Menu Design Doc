Step 1: The "Brain" (Data & Types)
We need a central place to store the drink data so both the Admin page and the Public page can see it.

Copy & Paste this into Cursor (Composer):

"I want to add a drink menu feature to my existing website.

Create a new file types/drink.ts (or types.ts) and define a Drink interface with:

id, name, description, price, category, image, ingredients list, and an 'isFeatured' boolean.

Create a generic data file data/sampleDrinks.ts with 6 high-end cocktail examples (Sidecar, Old Fashioned, Espresso Martini, etc.) matching that interface.

Create a simple state hook (or context) that allows me to add, update, and delete drinks from this list.

Please analyze my current project structure first to decide where these files best fit."

Step 2: The "Face" (The Minimalist Presenter)
This is the client-facing page. Since you mentioned wanting a minimalist theme earlier, we will instruct Cursor to strip away the noise.

Copy & Paste this into Cursor:

"Create a new component called MenuPresenter.

Design Rules:

STRICT Minimalist aesthetic. Large amounts of whitespace.

Use a refined, thin sans-serif or elegant serif font for headers.

No heavy borders or shadows. Use spacing to separate elements.

Functionality:

Display the drinks from our data source in a responsive grid.

Each item should show the Name, the Ingredients (separated by small dots), and the Price.

Group them by Category (e.g., 'Signature', 'Classics').

If isFeatured is true, give that drink a special layout highlight at the top.

Please ensure this component fits into my existing page layout wrapper."

Step 3: The "Control Room" (Admin/Manager)
This is the hidden dashboard for you to manage the menu.

Copy & Paste this into Cursor:

"Now create a MenuManager component.

Features:

A clean list view of all current drinks with 'Edit' and 'Delete' buttons.

A 'Create New Drink' button that opens a modal or a slide-over form.

The form needs inputs for all the fields in our Drink interface.

Use my existing UI components (buttons, inputs) if I have them; otherwise, style them with Tailwind to match the site's theme.

This view should be functional and easy to use on mobile, in case I need to update the menu while at an event."
