You are a Senior Next.js SEO Specialist. I have run a professional SEO audit on this project (`toast-mobile-bar`) and received several failing grades that need immediate remediation.

Please execute the following 5 tasks to fix the "Thin Content", "Social", and "Identity" errors.

### TASK 1: Fix "Identity Schema" & Canonical Tag (Critical)
The audit flagged "No Organization or Person Schema identified" and "Missing Canonical Tag".
- **Action:** In `app/layout.tsx`, update the `<head>` or existing Schema script.
- **Inject this specific JSON-LD:**
  ```json
  {
    "@context": "[https://schema.org](https://schema.org)",
    "@type": "Organization",
    "name": "TOAST Mobile Bar Co.",
    "url": "[https://www.toastmobile.bar](https://www.toastmobile.bar)",
    "logo": "[https://www.toastmobile.bar/logo.png](https://www.toastmobile.bar/logo.png)",
    "sameAs": [
      "[https://www.instagram.com/toastbar.houston/](https://www.instagram.com/toastbar.houston/)",
      "[https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=61585955603748](https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=61585955603748)"
    ],
    "contactPoint": {
      "@type": "ContactPoint",
      "telephone": "[Your Phone Number]",
      "contactType": "customer service",
      "areaServed": "US",
      "availableLanguage": "English"
    }
  }
Action: In app/layout.tsx metadata, add the metadataBase and alternates (canonical) fields:

TypeScript

metadataBase: new URL('[https://www.toastmobile.bar](https://www.toastmobile.bar)'),
alternates: {
  canonical: '/',
}
TASK 2: Fix "Social Grade F"
The audit failed to find social links.

Action: Open components/Footer.tsx (or wherever the footer is located).

Update Links: Replace any # placeholders with:

Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/toastbar.houston/

Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=61585955603748

Add 'SameAs' Meta: Ensure these links are visible to crawlers.

TASK 3: Fix "Thin Content" (Word Count < 323)
The audit flagged the homepage as "Thin Content". We need to add ~400 words of high-value text without cluttering the design.

Action: Create a new component components/SEOContent.tsx.

Content: Generate an "FAQ" section and a "Why Choose Dry Hire?" section.

Keywords to include naturally: "Mobile Bartender Houston", "Wedding Bar Rental", "TABC Certified", "Dry Hire Service", "Cocktail Catering".

Design: Use an "Accordion" or "Collapsible" style so it doesn't ruin the visual flow, but the text is readable in the DOM.

Import: Add this component to app/page.tsx just above the Footer.

TASK 4: Add Analytics
The audit detected no analytics tool.

Action: Install the Vercel Analytics package if not present (npm install @vercel/analytics).

Implementation: In app/layout.tsx, import <Analytics /> from @vercel/analytics/react and place it inside the <body> tag.

TASK 5: Keyword Consistency
The audit noticed "menu" and "service" are missing from the Title tags.

Action: Update the title in app/page.tsx metadata to: title: 'TOAST Mobile Bar Co. | Luxury Bar Menu & Wedding Services'
