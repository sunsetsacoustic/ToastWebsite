PROJECT SPEC: TOAST MINI (KIDS EXPANSION)
1. THE STRATEGY
Goal: Sell to the "Pinterest Mom" without damaging the "Luxury Wedding" brand. The Solution: Create a dedicated sub-page (/mini). Do not mix this content on the homepage. The aesthetic will be "Dark Mode Neon"—keeping your Midnight Navy base but swapping the elegant silver accents for vibrant neon gradients (Cyan/Pink). It should feel like a "VIP Lounge for Kids."

2. SITE ARCHITECTURE
New Route: toastmobile.bar/mini

Navigation Update:

In your Main Navbar, under "Services", add a dropdown item: "TOAST Mini (Kids)".

Alternative: Add a text link in the Footer: "Kids Parties."

3. DESIGN SYSTEM (The "Vibe")
Background: Same #001F3F (Midnight Navy) or #000000 (Black) as main site.

Typography: Same Sans-Serif font (Inter/Roboto), but use BOLD/ALL CAPS more frequently.

Accent Colors (CSS Variables):

--neon-blue: #00F0FF; (For "Ocean Water" elements)

--neon-pink: #FF00FF; (For "Tiger's Blood" elements)

--neon-green: #00FF00; (For "Zombie" elements)

Visual Motif: "Glow" effects on buttons and headers (CSS box-shadow or text-shadow).

4. PAGE LAYOUT (Wireframe)
Section A: The Hero (Above the Fold)
Headline: "THE COOLEST BAR IN TOWN."

Sub-headline: "Luxury Dirty Soda Bars for the Next Generation."

Visual: A photo of a clear cup with bright blue soda + cream, sitting on your navy bar top.

CTA Button: "BOOK THE PARTY" (Gradient background: Pink to Blue).

Section B: The Concept (The "What is it?")
Layout: 2-Column Split.

Left (Text):

Header: "NOT YOUR AVERAGE JUICE BOX."

Body: "We bring the viral 'Dirty Soda' trend to your backyard. Crisp sparkling soda, infused with premium fruit syrups, finished with a splash of sweet cream. Zero mess for you, 100% cool for them."

Right (Image): Close up of cream being poured into soda (The "Cloud" effect).

Section C: The Menu Grid (Visual Heavy)
Title: "THE DIRTY SODA MENU"

Layout: 3-Column Grid of "Cards".

Card Design: Dark card with a thin neon border.

TIGER'S BLOOD (Pink Border)

Strawberry + Coconut + Cream

SHARK ATTACK (Blue Border)

Blue Raspberry + Lime + Gummy Shark

THE UNICORN (Purple Border)

Cotton Candy + Sprinkles + Cream

(Add the other drinks from the menu we designed)

Section D: The Package (Pricing)
Design: A single, centered "Ticket" style container.

Header: "THE MINI PACKAGE"

Price: $500 FLAT RATE

Disclaimer: For ages 6-16. Travel fees may apply outside 20 miles.

Section E: The Booking Form (or Link)
Option A (Fastest): Link to your existing "Contact" page, but pass a query param ?type=mini so you know it's a kid's party.

Option B (Better): A simple form right there:

Name, Email, Date, "How many kids?"

5. ASSET LIST (What you need to gather)
To build this, you need 3 specific photos. Do not use stock photos of kids (it looks cheesy). Use photos of the product.

Hero Image: High-contrast shot of the "Shark Attack" (Blue drink) on your bar.

Process Image: Action shot of pouring the cream.

Garnish Shot: Close up of the gummy worms/sharks.

6. COPY & PASTE CODE SNIPPET (Tailwind CSS Idea)
