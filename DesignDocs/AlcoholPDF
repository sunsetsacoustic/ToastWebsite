THE TOAST ALCOHOL BUYING GUIDE
Professional Advice for the Perfect Pour
THE GOLDEN RULE: "THE ONE HOUR FORMULA"
The industry standard calculation for alcohol consumption is simple: 1 Guest = 1 Drink per Hour.
The Math: [Guest Count] x [Hours of Service] = Total Drinks Needed
Example: 100 Guests x 4 Hours = 400 Drinks.
The Buffer: Always add a 10-15% safety buffer. It is better to return unopened bottles than to run dry.



THE RATIOS: KNOW YOUR CROWD
Not every party is the same. Choose the profile that fits your guest list.
1. The "Standard Wedding" (Balanced)
20% Beer
30% Wine
50% Liquor (Cocktails)
2. The "Party Crowd" (Younger/Heavy Drinkers)
15% Beer
15% Wine
70% Liquor (Heavy focus on Tequila/Vodka)
3. The "Daytime Affair" (Showers/Brunches)
10% Beer
60% Wine (Champagne/Rosé)
30% Liquor (Light spirits like Gin/Vodka)

THE "SECRET" SHOPPING LIST TIPS
1. The "Returnable" Rule
Shop at major retailers like Spec's or Total Wine. They usually allow you to return unopened, unchilled bottles with a receipt.
Strategy: Buy 20% more than you think you need. Keep the extras in a separate box under the table. If we don't open them, you get your money back.
2. Cans > Kegs
We strongly recommend cans over kegs.
Why? Kegs require taps, heavy lifting, and deposit fees. If you don't finish a keg, you throw the beer away. If you don't finish a case of cans, you take them home.
3. Don't Forget the Ice
If your venue does not have an ice machine, you must provide ice.
Cooling Ice: 1 lb per guest (To chill beer/wine).
Service Ice: 1 lb per guest (To put in drinks).
Total: For 100 guests, buy 200 lbs of ice.
