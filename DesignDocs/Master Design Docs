Act as a Senior Frontend Developer and UI/UX Designer.

I need you to build a single-page landing website for a premium mobile bartending service called "TOAST Mobile Bar" (ToastMobile.bar). The business is a husband-and-wife-owned "Dry Hire" service in Texas.

**Tech Stack:**
- Next.js 14 (App Router)
- Tailwind CSS
- Lucide React (for icons)
- Framer Motion (for subtle entrance animations)
- Shadcn UI (if available, otherwise use raw Tailwind components)

**Design System ("Warm Luxury"):**
- **Background:** Deep Charcoal (#1A1A1A) - Use this for the main background.
- **Primary Text:** Cream/Off-White (#F5F5F5).
- **Brand Accent:** Champagne Gold (#D4AF37) - Use for buttons, borders, and key icons.
- **Fonts:**
  - Headings: "Playfair Display" (Serif, Elegant, Bold).
  - Body: "Lato" or "Inter" (Sans-serif, Clean).
- **Vibe:** Celebratory, warm, trustworthy, and high-end. Avoid "industrial" or "gritty" looks.

**Page Structure & Content:**

1. **Navigation:**
   - Logo text: "TOAST" (Playfair Display, Bold, Tracking-wide).
   - Links: How it Works, Calculator, Services, Contact.
   - CTA Button: "Book Now" (Gold background, Charcoal text).

2. **Hero Section:**
   - Headline: "RAISE A GLASS. WE'LL HANDLE THE REST."
   - Subhead: "Texas' premier dry-hire mobile bar service. You bring the spirits, we bring the service, style, and stress-free planning."
   - Primary Button: "Calculate Your Menu" (Scrolls to the Calculator section).

3. **The 'Toast Calculator' (Core Feature - Interactive):**
   - Title: "The Toast Calculator"
   - Description: "Don't guess. Know exactly what to buy."
   - **Logic Required:**
     - Inputs: Slider for `Guests` (10-300), Slider for `Hours` (2-8), Select for `Vibe` (Light, Average, Heavy).
     - Math:
       - Base Rule: 2 drinks first hour + 1 drink per additional hour.
       - Vibe Modifier: Light (0.7x), Average (1.0x), Heavy (1.3x).
       - Total Drinks = (Guests * ((Hours - 1) + 2)) * Modifier.
     - Breakdown:
       - Beer: 50% of Total Drinks (Display as "Cases of Beer" -> Divide by 24).
       - Wine: 25% of Total Drinks (Display as "Bottles of Wine" -> Divide by 5).
       - Liquor: 25% of Total Drinks (Display as "Liquor Bottles (750ml)" -> Divide by 17).
   - *Design Note:* Make this look like a premium tool. Dark card background, gold sliders, live updating numbers.

4. **"How It Works" (3 Columns):**
   - Icon: Clipboard/List -> Title: "The Plan" -> Text: "Use our tech to generate your perfect shopping list."
   - Icon: ShoppingBag -> Title: "The Buy" -> Text: "You purchase the alcohol directly (no markups)."
   - Icon: Wine/Martini -> Title: "The Toast" -> Text: "We arrive with the bar, ice, mixers, and garnishes to serve."

5. **"About Us" Section:**
   - Title: "Family Owned & Operated"
   - Text: "Run by a husband and wife team in Texas. We combine tech-forward planning with old-school hospitality."
